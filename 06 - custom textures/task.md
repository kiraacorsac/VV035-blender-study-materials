# Project 4 - Custom texture

Create a custom PBR texture set from *YOUR OWN PHOTO* of any material around you. This material should definitely have 

- Diffuse map
- Normal map

and also at least one of the following:

- Height map (note that in current version of Blender, this might result in significant artifacts) 
- Roughness map
- Metalness map
- Alpha map
- whatever-else-might-be-interesting map
- Tileability

## Tips: 

 - You can use the **Materialize** software to do most of the work, but you'll probably need to use some photo-editing software too.
 - Make sure to take the photo with flat lighting and minimal amount of visible shadow
 - Use as high of a resolution as posible. 2000x2000 is the usualy the minimum to get nice results without tiling.
 - Good height maps are generated when there is some color diffence between the low and the high parts. However, this sometimes goes against the need for a flat lighting. Don't make it too hard on yourself by photographing surfaces that are too plain!
 - Phone is sufficient for taking the photo, but DSLR is better. 
 - You need a sharp photo. Use a tripod, or set your phone on a flat surface.
 - Don't use the height map if it's mostly flat anyways. Blender does not like low quality bump maps and acts up sometimes.
  - If you are not used to taking/processing photos at all, don't strain yourself and pick something simpler. Bark or some rocks, for example, suit the requirements just fine!
