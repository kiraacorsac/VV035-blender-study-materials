# Where do I get the textures?

My favorite free PBR texture sources are:

- https://texturehaven.com/
- https://freepbr.com/
- https://cc0textures.com/
- https://www.poliigon.com/ (most of the textures are not free, but they have a decent selection of free textures)

For HDRI textures: 
- https://hdrihaven.com/
- http://noemotionhdrs.net/
- https://hdrmaps.com/freebies/
- https://hdri-skies.com/
