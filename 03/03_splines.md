# Curves
# hahaha did not have the time to write this
*Curves* are objects expressed by mathematical functions, that take up a form of... well, a curve. They are useful for quickly and proceduraly creating an organic or a flexible form. 

## Working with curves. 

To add a curve, **Shift + A** and select a desired curve type. In general, *Path* and *Bezier* are the most useful, but if you need a closed loop, you can add the *Circle* curve.
